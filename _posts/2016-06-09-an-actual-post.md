I am currently in the midst of a stretch of planned unemployment. The worst thing about it is the fact that I have to tell people this when they ask about what I'm doing in Boston. I know that, if I wished, I could have lined up a job immediately after leaving Mu Sigma. Instead, I am spending 8-10 hours a day programming for the first time in my life, and I love it. I don't have any grand projects. I'm not building a prototype for a startup. I'm learning new things. My gamble is that these few weeks of relying on my savings will pay dividends very quickly. It's not a very risky bet,

I have two lists of things I might do before I start interviewing in earnest. I think of them as "chops" and "aesthetics." Building my chops probably doesn't need definition: reading CLRS, solving problems on [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com), stretching my abilities with the command line. "Writing a lot of code" also falls into this bucket, although I'm nowhere near being what anyone should consider a high-volume programmer. Chops are chops, and I need to get them.

However, all of this is worthless if no one finds out. I want "aesthetics" to describe how people evaluate me. Aesthetics is having an active twitter. Aesthetics can overlap with chops, like learning Jeykll to build a website. Aesthetics can be expensive, like buying a MacBook because no rockstars outside Microsoft use a Lenovo that could pass for a desktop. Some, like finally catching up on *Silicon Valley*, need mental maneuvering to be counted as productive. But (some of) these things are important.

I've got to have a mix, and I haven't spent too much time worrying about what is what. I figure if I can talk about it an in interview, it's worth doing. They say that stuff is a subset of useful stuff.
