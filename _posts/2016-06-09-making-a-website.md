Making a website for myself. Using Github pages and Jeykll because I think that's really all I need. 
Thank you to [Jonathon McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for his excellent tutorial on the subject, which I am following.
It has the advantage of doing everything through Github's web app, rather than going back and forth between editors and the command line and installing things to start out.
The downside of this, of course, is that I have to use Github's editor.
The downside of Github's web editor is that when I hit CTRL+S every three seconds it trys to save the web page.

On the topic of things that annoy me: Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and most of the Golden State Warriors. 
Klay Thompson's OK, but we would never be friends. Just tried to save the web page again.
