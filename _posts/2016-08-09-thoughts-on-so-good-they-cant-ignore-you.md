title: Thoughts on <em>So Good They Can't Ignore You</em>
---

Today I read Cal Newport's 2012 manifesto, *So Good They Can't Ignore You*. It's on my currently-favorite subject: making career decisions. While reading I took some notes, elaborated below.

Overall, I really liked it. Clear and well-written, I think most of what he fundamentally says is correct. This post is not a book review. I've just taken some points and responded/elaborated.

## Accounting for Talent

One thing not communicated well in the book is the pivotal question of "what am I good at?"

For instance, I reject Newport's claim that the difference in guitar skill between him and Jordan Tice is mainly explained by differences in practice style. As a sixteen-year-old, four years after picking up the instrument, Tice was touring with well-known professionals, while Newport occasionally played local gigs. The book paints Tice as a transcendent talent (the word "prodigy" is used) but seems oblivious to the fact that talent is a major part of the equation.

Success often implies that one has practiced, but practice is far from the whole story. Career choices made without accounting for skill are, I believe, recklessly made.

## Hard Work Is Good, Too

I remembered something Andrew Ng said in a [Huffington Post interview](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/13/andrew-ng_n_7267682.html), in response to the question "Do you have any helpful habits or routines?" Ng talked about how, if one could read six research papers a week for two years, one would have made "a fantastic investment in your own long term development." That's not an easy thing to do, but (I imagine) it's that kind of study that often separates the top from the middle. Newport has that exactly right. "Capital" is a good word.

Because of that, I kept thinking back to Richard Hamming's talk "You and Your Research." He likened knowledge (Newport's career capital) to compound interest. Hamming relates it here:

> I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three of four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not [*Debatable - Gavin*]. Well I went storming into [Hendrik] Bode's office and said, "How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?" He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said "You would be surprised, Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years." I simply slunk out of the office!
>
> ...Given two people with the exact same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime.

Investing in your capital increases the rate at which your capital grows! I love the analogy!

## Survivorship Bias

This is a bit of a nitpick but I need to write about it because it was screaming at me when I read it.

We read about Amy Wrzesniewski's paper about
* Jobs, wage-earning mechanisms
* Careers, mechanisms for advancement in the organization and life
* Callings, in which the position is part of the worker's identity.

We read specifically about administrative assistants and how, at the college surveyed, they group was split almost evenly between job, career, and calling. The main difference between these groups, we learn, is that the people who feel their position is a calling have been there longer. Newport claims that the "most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do."

You don't have to be a statistical whiz to tear the above argument apart. The paper is [here](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/amywrzesniewski/documents/Jobscareersandcallings.pdf).
The paper surveyed only 24 administrative assistants, and does no statistical analysis due to the small sample size.

|   | "Job" | "Career" | "Calling" |   
|---|---|---|---|
| n | 9 | 7 | 8 |   
| Job Tenure | 4.2 | 6.8 | 9.2 |  

Survivorship bias, right? Wrzesniewski doesn't try to adjust for it, because the paper only addressed it in passing. But *of course* the people who feel their work is a vital part of their identity have longer tenures! The people who view their work as a way to pay the bills have higher turnover!

It's way out of bounds to use this data to support the claim, as Newport does, that "passion takes time."

## Types of Market: Auction and Winner-Take-All

Newport talks about identifying the market you're in: auction or winner-take-all. Members in winner-take-all markets compete only on one type of skill, while auction markets are everything else.

My first thought was to a [blog post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/28/non-dual-awareness/) by Scott Alexander on "dualist" job markets, which are marked by a binary classification of success or failure. An example is professorship. Get tenure? Successful. Don't get tenure? Not successful (as a professor, anyway).

Alexander contrasts this with computer programming, where there is no distinct cutoff between success and failure in the field.

After reading into what Newport was writing, though, I think his language was suggestive of something he's not saying. His wording is unambiguous:

> In a winner-take-all market, there is only one type of career capital available, and lots of different people competing for it.

His central example is TV writing, where there is a strong divide between those who are successful and those who are not. But the way he defines winner-take-all has nothing to do with the types of success in the field. If my chosen field is Rails development, there is only one career capital: Rails ability. However, I don't think anyone would call the market "winner-take-all" in the way it is commonly used.

## What is the goal of advice to an arbitrary person?

Newport claims that "follow your passion" is bad advice. But what is bad advice? What is the goal of advice in general when given to an arbitrary group of people?

Should advice serve to increase the happiness of the receiver(s)? Maybe it should try to make the world a better place? Or help the listeners achieve their stated goals, regardless of happiness?

This is not an easy question but it is fundamental to the book's theses.

## Do we need remarkable careers?

Newport brings up Self-Determination Theory to help his case that passion is not necessary for workplace happiness. SDT claims that workplace motivation arises from autonomy, competence, and relatedness to others. He uses the fact that passion's exclusion from the list as an argument against it.

Rule #4 centers on how a mission can help bring satisfaction to your work. Mission is not on SDT's list of three. Newport does not bring this up.

Unlike with his arguments on control, Newport failed to convince me that mission will necessarily bring happiness to my career and life. It certainly makes the job sexier and I'm sure people who have a mission claim it increases their happiness.
