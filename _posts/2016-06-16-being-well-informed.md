I call someone "well-informed" when they can converse on many different topics. I call someone "knowledgeable" when they have a real understanding of the topics upon which they converse. Put like that, the difference between those labels is obvious. But I've been thinking about the two concepts and how they are related.

For instance, I *do* have a sound bite I repeat about LIGO, along the lines of  "it's a paradigm-shifting discovery that will usher in a new era of physics." If the conversation turns that way, I can even talk about how the two detectors are located at different places in the US to work around seismographic interference and roughly determine the origin of the waves. But if pressed on how the detector works, I cannot say much beyond "they built a sensitive device that can detect gravitational waves." I am "informed" on the topic, but I am certainly not knowledgeable.

Of course, being well-informed is an easy indicator of being knowledgeable. An acquaintance once described himself as a "math groupie," being up-front about his excitement but lack of direct knowledge of the subject. That's ok; he has a PhD in Computer Science. Knowledgeable people are almost always well-informed, and it is a natural and easy mistake to conflate the two.

I was reading a blog post by Scott Aaronson, who is very smart, called [Can Computers Become Conscious?](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2756) He posted his response from a panel discussion with the also-very-smart Sir Roger Penrose, who famously answered "yes" in his book *The Emperor's New Mind*. Two brilliant people discussing quantum mechanics, GÃ¶del, Turing, brains, and the human experience? Count me in!

Reading the post, I had a revelation. Aaronson acknowledges Penrose's questions as valid, and proceeds to point out where they differ on the answers. I understood all the words used. I believe that computers are capable of consciousness. But here's the sticky point that became apparent: I am not able to directly refute Penrose's technical points, even though I disagree with him!

Compared to these two intellectual giants, I have a child's understanding quantum mechanics, theoretical computer science, and logic. Directly engaging either of them in a debate on this topic would be an embarrassment. Their discussion takes place a thousand feet above where I made my decision.

I do believe that computers can become conscious, but I should not fool myself into thinking that I can engage in honest debate on the topic. I do not grasp the pivotal conceptual points.

So of course reading that blog post was not going to change my mind! In a one-on-one debate I could not keep up with Aaronson, let alone with one of the brightest men alive in Penrose. It was not going to increase my real knowledge of the topic, either, since I am already conversant enough to talk about it at parties. Why, then, would I bother reading it?

My hunch is that reading about science and mathematics fulfills a desire to actually do science in mathematics. After reading an article about LIGO, I walk away feeling smarter. I also expect that this superficially-expressed curiosity might be a reaction to social pressure to seem smart, subconsciously hoping that people mistake my words about parallax for actual physics knowledge. I can only guess.

I will tie this post off with a false dichotomy. There's a dusty copy of *The Emperor's New Mind* in my bedroom that I could go and read right now. I'd walk away better informed but not more knowledgeable. Instead, I could spend that time extending my knowledge of quantum mechanics or deterministic automata. That latter is hard work, but the work that should be done to really grow.
