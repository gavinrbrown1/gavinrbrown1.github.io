A month, it turns out, is a long time. It has been one month since I last decided to go into work, kicking off my current period of unemployment. I've learned a lot and realized how much I need to learn. I have really enjoyed the time, but I am more than ready to move forward.

At Mu Sigma, my favorite days were the days where I got to play around with new data. Learning something from a real dataset is a real treat to me. The problem framing, model tuning, presentation, and storytelling all brought their own challenges and attributes, but nothing could beat sitting down with the data for the first time.

Of all the problems InterviewBit threw at me, one stands out. It made me laugh:

> Given an array `A` filled with a permutation of elements in the range `[0, len(A)-1]`, rearrange the array so that `A[i]` becomes `A[A[i]]`. Use only constant space.

I laughed because I had no idea how to solve it, and I knew there was going to be a good trick waiting at the end. What an elegant problem! It took me a few seconds to even understand what they were asking for. This wasn't some problem where the method is trivial but you have to handle all eight edge cases separately. This was one of those problems where the *brute force* algorithm is trivial, and the constrained solution seems like magic.

My mother believes my Long Trail trip satisfies some need to find something. I think the answer is simpler: I love hiking all day and sleeping under a tarp. It makes me happy in the same way new data makes me happy, like clever solutions make me happy.

So I'll be in the woods for a few weeks. After that I'm going to take a nice long shower, shave, and go shake some hands and solve some problems. Cannot wait to start a new chapter.
