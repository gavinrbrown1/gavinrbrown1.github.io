<p font-size=1em>In middle school I picked up a book on Ruby because I met some high schoolers who could code. I burned through it, never figured out how to do anything outside the Ruby interpreter, and didn't program again until college. After taking classed in physics, mathematics, economics, and philosophy and working in with data in industry, I have decided to move programming from "side skill" to "vocation."</p>
<p>I have a five-page list of topics I want to study, from computer science to biology, and I always want to learn more. I'm excited join Boston's programming world, and can't wait to get working.</p>
